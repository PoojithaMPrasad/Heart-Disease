# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Description 
       Healthcare today faces the challenge of providing practical, accurate diagnoses and high-quality services. In recent years, heart diseases have ranked as the leading cause of death worldwide, but they can also be controlled and managed effectively. An illness can only be managed accurately when detected at the right time. Recognizing heart disease at the onset phase is crucial to avoid disastrous consequences. Analyzing large amounts of data and predicting heart diseases is assisted by several Data Mining and ML tools. An analysis of Logistic Regression, Nave Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and the ensemble Method of XGBoost is presented here to compare the most efficient approaches.
